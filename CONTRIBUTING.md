## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages :memo:

✨ How to write meaningful commit messages: ✨

- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add new feature" instead of "Added new feature")
- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to..." instead of "Moving item to...")
- Limit the first line (Subject Line) to 50 characters or less.
- Capitalize the Subject Line.
- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
- Avoid ending the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at 72 characters.
- Use the body to explain what, why, and how.
- Reference [Issues](https://github.com/khadeshyam/kontestify/issues) 🐛 and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/khadeshyam/kontestify/pulls) 🔄 as needed.
